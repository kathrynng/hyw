  To run the website, you will need a mysql server running. Connection information can be edited at **connection.php**. Open **loaddata.php** using your localhost- this will redirect you to **main.php** with a preloaded database.

HeyyoWorld project starts with the main Discover page **main.php**, on this page any type of user is able to navigate through different pages by using the navigation bar at the top. The client/freelancer can login using the _**LOGIN**_ button.
